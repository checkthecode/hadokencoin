**HadokenCoin (HDK)**

HadokenCoin is an innovative, secure and energy efficient PoW/PoS coin. It uses a faster PoW distribution mechanism to distribute the initial coins, then after 1 weeks the coin is basically transferred to a pure PoS coin, where the generation of the coin is mainly through the PoS interests.

HadokenCoin also adopt a variable PoS rate, which gives the highest payout at 50% the first year, then decrease 10% per year until the 5th year it reaches annual interest rate of 10%, then it will remain at this rate.

Because after 1 weeks it is basically a pure PoS coin, it does not need to be intensively mined, as the PoW payout will remain the minimum. Most coins will be generated through PoS, thus it is a coin that will save a lot of energy compared to other coins.

HadokenCoin will have a total of 150 million coins. Initially each block will deliver 1000  coins .  

PoS will start after at least 7 days of holding of the coins in the wallet. With PoS, the coin is more resilient to 51% attack.
